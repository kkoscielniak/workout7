What's your excuse not to do some morning exercises? Not enough time? No place to perform some? No money for heavy equipment?

Now you don't have any. All you need is your body, a wall, a chair and 7 MINUTES of free time.

7-minute workout is a high-intensivity workout which consists of 12 exercises done step-by-step in short intervals. On the other hand Workout 7 is an app, which will conduct you through all these exercises with a timer and the helpful pictures. 

This workout was described in details by New York Times (http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/).

What's new:
